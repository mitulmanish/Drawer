# Drawer

`Drawer` helps you create a draggable View Controller.

What does `Draggable` mean in this context?.
`Draggable`: The presented view will have ability to be vertically dragged across the screen. You will be able to use the pan gestures to move the presented view through different draggable states.

The presented View is going to have three draggable or sticky states
  - open
  - mid
  - collapsed
  
This sort of UI is specially useful when you would like to create a reactive app where changes in a modally presented view are reflected in the presenting view.
