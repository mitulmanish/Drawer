# Drawer

`Drawer` helps you create a draggable View Controller.

What does `Draggable` mean in this context?.
`Draggable`: The presented view will have ability to be vertically dragged across the screen. You will be able to use the pan gestures to move the presented view through different draggable states.

The presented View is going to have three draggable or sticky states
  - open
  - mid
  - collapsed
  
This sort of UI is specially useful when you would like to create a reactive app where changes in a modally presented view are reflected in the presenting view.

|Open|Mid|Collapsed|
|---|---|---|

Usage

Create a custom transition delegate and present the view controller
```
        transitionDelegate = DraggableTransitionDelegate()
        let vc = YourViewController()
        vc.transitioningDelegate = transitionDelegate
        vc.modalPresentationStyle = .custom
        vc.selectionDelegate = self
        present(vc, animated: true)
```

Make sure your view controller conforms to `KeyboardDismissableDraggableView`

```
extension YourViewController: KeyboardDismissableDraggableView {
    var scrollView: UIScrollView {
        tableView
    }
         
    func handleInteraction(enabled: Bool) {
         [tableView, searchBar].forEach {
            $0.isUserInteractionEnabled = enabled
        }
    }
    
    func dismissKeyboard() {
        guard searchBar.isFirstResponder else { return }
        searchBar.resignFirstResponder()
    }
}
```

Note: `handleInteraction(enabled: Bool)` is called everytime the the drawer changes it state changes from
`open` to `mid`
`mid` to `open`
`mid` to `collapsed`
`collapsed` to `mid`

It's important that you disable your scroll view when `enable` has `false` value
You can simply acheive this simply doing 
`yourScrollView.isUserInteractionEnabled` = `enabled`
